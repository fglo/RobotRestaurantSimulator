A new concept-restaurant is starting up, where the kitchen is staffed by a robot. This chef-robot can perform basically any cooking action, but it is slow at things because it is general-purpose. You've been hired to create a system to assign tasks in their kitchen. The owner asked you to write a program which takes orders and assigns them to the chef-robot. There will be more orders coming in than the chef-robot can account for, so expect a backlog of orders to build up.

Design a class that represents an order, a class representing the chef-robot who cooks the order, and a class that dispatches the orders to the robot.
